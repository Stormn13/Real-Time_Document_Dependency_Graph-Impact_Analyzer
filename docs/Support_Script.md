# Support Script

When speaking with customers about refunds, support agents should:

1. Check the purchase date and confirm it's within the refund window (see `RefundPolicy.md`).
2. Verify product condition: unopened physical items are eligible.
3. If customer mentions a 14-day refund, clarify current policy (see `RefundPolicy.md`).

Sample lines:
- "Let me check if this purchase falls within our refund period."
- "Our refund policy (REFUND_POLICY) allows returns under specific conditions."
